# Nepali Sentiment Analyzer

This is a simple Flask web application that predicts the sentiment of Nepali text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Note *** The model may make mistakes as it is trained on a relatively small dataset (~1000 samples)***

The model uses TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, trained on Nepali comments and posts collected from Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, news articles, and Twitter.


## Features

- Input Nepali text in the web form  
- Predict sentiment instantly
